# How It Works

1. Signup as a user and login.
2. Report your minutes spent on classes/homework/projects daily.
3. See your stats tracked in your own personal leaderboard (great for metrics when discussing in interviews/visualizing your own personal growth in your coding journey).
4. On the main screen before login, it will show a leaderboard of all 100Devs Members.
